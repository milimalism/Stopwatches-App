# Stopwatches-App

The intent behind creating this app was to have an efficient way to time daily tasks over a long period of time. Once you see how long you spend on tasks like getting ready, eating lunch etc, you can better optimise your time. 


The app allows the user to create multiple labelled stopwatches. Timing a task is as easy as pressing the start and stop button. The amount of time spent per day is then displayed in bar graphs by the week.
